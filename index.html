    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
   
         <ol style="color: brown;">

        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li> <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on sscreen, paper, or in other media.</li> <br>
        <li> <b class="lining">Css not necessary</b> <strong class="design">CSS saves a lot of work.</strong> It can control the layot of multiple web pages all at once</li> <br>
        <li class="decor">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</li> <br>
    </ol>
     
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>

    <ul style="color: brown; letter-spacing: 3px;">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal - by using style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <strong class="design">in this <br> tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</strong> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier <br> for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
   
    <p style="color: brown;">When comparing CSS class bs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also <br> special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.</p>
   
    <p style="color: brown;">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an eement has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the <br> element.</p>

    <p style="color: brown;">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to Target elements to which a style should be applied.</p><br>
